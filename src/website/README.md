## Working

- The HTML has links to the `script.js`, and `style.css`, and also to `Google Fonts`, and `FontAwesome`; and has one div in the body
- The JS creates elements, adds attributes, and adds all of the elements to the DOM.
- The JS file also has all the event listeners, which send the respective HTTP request to the Rest API, to interac with the db
- The CSS file has the styling for the webpage

<br>

- when the page first loads, it sends a `GET` request to get all the tasks from the db
- when pressed the delete button, the `DELETE` request is sent to the db
- when a new task is added, the `POST` request is sent to the db
- when a tasknme or status is changed, the `PUT` request is sent to the db
